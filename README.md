# copy-to-dropbox
An apple script to copy files to Dropbox every night.

TUTORIAL: 
Step #1 - Download the files from the github repository

Step #2 - Once this is done, open the Automator application. 

Step #3 - When prompted to create a file, at the bottom left of the prompt, choose the option that says "Open an Existing Document...". 

Step #4 - Navigate to the location in Finder where you have downloaded the copy-to-dropbox workflow and click the workflow. 

Step #5 - Once you have selected the copy-to-dropbox workflow, click open in the Finder window. 

Step #6 - By default, the input and output files are set to TestingDesktop and TestingDownloads respectively. To change the folder you want to copy files from, select the TestingDesktop item, click other in the prompt that appears, and navigate to and select the folder that you want to copy contents from. 

Step #7 - To change the folder you want to copy files to, select the TestingDownloads item, click other in the prompt that appears, and navigate to and select the folder that you want to copy the contents to. 

Step #8 - Once this is done, make sure to save your changes and open the Calendar application. 

Step #9 - Double click on the a date that appears in the calendar that you would like for the script to run on. 

Step #10 - If you wish, you can select the option to repeat the script every day, every week, and so forth as well as the time you want this script to run. This is completely up to you to decide. 

Step #11 - After you have decided the frequency and dates during which you want this script to run, select the option to make an alert. 

Step #12 - At the bottom of the list that appears after you have done this, click the "Custom..." button. 

Step #13 - Select the "Message with sound" item. 

Step #14 - In the list that appears, select "Open File". 

Step #15 - Another button titled "Calendar" should appear as soon as you select the "Open File" option. Click this button. 

Step #16 - Click this button and in the list that appears, click the "Other..." option. 

Step #17 - In the Finder prompt that appears,navigate to the location of the automator workflow that also contains the changes you made. 

Step #18 - Once you have selected the workflow in the finder prompt, click open. 

Step #19 - Once you have done this, there will be another button at the bottom of the prompt that states how much time after or before you have set to as the time to run the workflow you would like to run the script. Once again, this is completely up to you but I personally have it set to "At time of event." If you would like to do this, all you do is select the "minutes before" item, and in the list that appears, select "At time of event." 

Step #20 - After you have done this, select the "Ok" button. 

Congratulations! You're done! Now if you would like to do the same thing again but with different folders simply make a copy of the copy-to-dropbox item and repeat all the previous steps but using the new copy-to-dropbox item that you have made that contains the changes!
